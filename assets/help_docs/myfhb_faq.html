                <p class="strong gsearch">What is Teleconsultation?</p>
                <p class="gsearch">In simple words, it is remote healthcare consultation given by a certified physician to a patient over the internet through video calls and chats using smartphones and computers.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card contsearch">
                <p class="strong gsearch">Will Teleconsultation give a similar experience as Clinic consultation?</p>
                <p class="gsearch">All aspects of clinic consultations except for physical examination would be present in teleconsultation, with the added benefit of talking to your doctor from the comfort of your homes. All questions concerning the symptoms, illness,
                    and treatment can be discussed, diagnosed, and prescribed in real-time.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card contsearch">
                <p class="strong gsearch">How do I receive online consultation using the myFHB app?</p>
                <p class="gsearch">Click the telehealth tab on the home screen. Select your doctor, Schedule an appointment, and you will be promptly notified of your appointment. Start receiving your teleconsultation at the scheduled time over video/audio call. Receive
                    prescriptions digitally. And enjoy post-consulting care.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card contsearch">
                <p class="strong gsearch">Why should I choose myFHB? </p>
                <p class="gsearch">For a start,</p>
                <p class="gsearch">myFHB helps you receive teleconsultations only with the doctors you know and trust. After you receive a teleconsultation, there are no limitations on the number of days for post-consulting. Even if the doctor wishes to call you after a
                    teleconsultation, you will incur no extra charge. Sheela, your personal health assistant, captures your health vitals, and these health vitals will be securely shared with your doctors continuously, meaning you will receive proactive
                    care from your doctor.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card contsearch">
                <p class="strong gsearch">On what basis should I choose Doctors in myFHB?</p>
                <p class="gsearch">Choosing a doctor is always at the patient&rsquo;s discretion. QurHealth won&rsquo;t promote any doctors. But we recommend to always consult with doctors whom you know, whom you trust.</p>

            <div class="card contsearch">
                <p class="strong gsearch">Does myFHB provide telemedicine? </p>
                <p class="gsearch">No, as of now, myFHB focuses only on teleconsultation. While telemedicine refers to remote diagnosis and treatment of patients using technology, teleconsultation involves only doctors&rsquo; online consultation with patients.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card contsearch">
                <p class="strong gsearch">Is my teleconsultation private and secure?</p>
                <p class="gsearch">Absolutely! myFHB is built on a robust and secure infrastructure. Your teleconsultation is completely secure, private, and compliant with dynamic healthcare regulations. Your digitized health records and device readings are stored in a
                    centralized digital repository exclusive for your family.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card contsearch">

            <div class="card contsearch">
                <p class="strong gsearch">Will the fee be refunded if the doctor cancels my teleconsultation appointment?</p>
                <p class="gsearch">Yes, it will be refunded 100%.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card contsearch">
                <p class="strong gsearch">Will I be able to reschedule an appointment?</p>
                <p class="gsearch">Yes, but you can only reschedule before the start of the appointment.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card contsearch">
                <p class="strong gsearch">Will there be a cancellation fee if I cancel the appointment?</p>
                <p class="gsearch">We understand there are times where you had to cancel your appointment. But it also means you may be preventing another patient from getting that much-needed consultation. If you cancel an appointment, you may incur a cancellation fee.</p>
