            <h2 class="text-center">Login Page</h2>
            <p class="strong">Why am I required to give my personal info?</p>

            <p class="strong">Why do I need more than a username and a password to sign in?</p>

            <p class="strong">When does my Login Session expire?</p>

            <h3>Teleconsultation</h3>
            <p class="strong">What is Teleconsultation?</p>
            <p>In simple words, it is remote healthcare consultation given by a certified physician to a patient over the internet through video calls and chats using smartphones and computers.</p>
            <p class="strong">Will Teleconsultation give a similar experience as Clinic consultation?</p>
            <p>All aspects of clinic consultations except for physical examination would be present in teleconsultation, with the added benefit of talking to your doctor from the comfort of your homes. All questions concerning the symptoms, illness, and
                treatment can be discussed, diagnosed, and prescribed in real-time.</p>
            <p class="strong">Does myFHB provide telemedicine?</p>
            <p>No, as of now, myFHB focuses only on teleconsultation. While telemedicine refers to remote diagnosis and treatment of patients using technology, teleconsultation involves only doctors' online consultation with patients.</p>
            <p class="strong">Is my teleconsultation private and secure?</p>
            <p>Absolutely! myFHB is built on a robust and secure infrastructure. Your teleconsultation is completely secure, private, and compliant with dynamic healthcare regulations. Your digitized health records and device readings are stored in a centralized
                digital repository exclusive for your family.</p>
            <p class="strong">Are all consultations appointment-based?</p>
            <p>Yes! you can schedule an appointment with the doctor of your choice and receive their consultation.</p>
            <p class="strong">Will the fee be refunded if the doctor cancels my teleconsultation appointment?</p>
            <p>Yes, it will be refunded 100%.</p>
            <p class="strong">Will I be able to reschedule an appointment?</p>
            <p>Yes, but you can only reschedule before the start of the appointment.</p>
            <p class="strong">Will there be a cancellation fee if I cancel the appointment?</p>
            <p>We understand there are times where you had to cancel your appointment. But it also means you may be preventing another patient from getting that much-needed consultation. If you cancel an appointment, you may incur a cancellation fee.</p>
            <p class="strong">Can I have a record of my past appointment discussions with the doctor?</p>
            <p>Yes, discussions made through chats can be accessed, but the platform will provide no audio/video recordings.</p>
            <h3>Homepage</h3>
