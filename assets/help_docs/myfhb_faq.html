            <h2>Teleconsultation</h2>
            <div class="card">
                <p class="strong">What is Teleconsultation?</p>
                <p>In simple words, it is remote healthcare consultation given by a certified physician to a patient over the internet through video calls and chats using smartphones and computers.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <p class="strong">Will Teleconsultation give a similar experience as Clinic consultation?</p>
                <p>All aspects of clinic consultations except for physical examination would be present in teleconsultation, with the added benefit of talking to your doctor from the comfort of your homes. All questions concerning the symptoms, illness,
                    and treatment can be discussed, diagnosed, and prescribed in real-time.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <p class="strong">How do I receive online consultation using the myFHB app?</p>
                <p>Click the telehealth tab on the home screen. Select your doctor, Schedule an appointment, and you will be promptly notified of your appointment. Start receiving your teleconsultation at the scheduled time over video/audio call. Receive
                    prescriptions digitally. And enjoy post-consulting care.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <p class="strong">Why should I choose myFHB? </p>
                <p>For a start,</p>
                <p>myFHB helps you receive teleconsultations only with the doctors you know and trust. After you receive a teleconsultation, there are no limitations on the number of days for post-consulting. Even if the doctor wishes to call you after a
                    teleconsultation, you will incur no extra charge. Sheela, your personal health assistant, captures your health vitals, and these health vitals will be securely shared with your doctors continuously, meaning you will receive proactive
                    care from your doctor.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <p class="strong">On what basis should I choose Doctors in myFHB?</p>
                <p>Choosing a doctor is always at the patient&rsquo;s discretion. QurHealth won&rsquo;t promote any doctors. But we recommend to always consult with doctors whom you know, whom you trust.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <p class="strong">Does myFHB provide telemedicine? </p>
                <p>No, as of now, myFHB focuses only on teleconsultation. While telemedicine refers to remote diagnosis and treatment of patients using technology, teleconsultation involves only doctors&rsquo; online consultation with patients.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <p class="strong">Is my teleconsultation private and secure?</p>
                <p>Absolutely! myFHB is built on a robust and secure infrastructure. Your teleconsultation is completely secure, private, and compliant with dynamic healthcare regulations. Your digitized health records and device readings are stored in a
                    centralized digital repository exclusive for your family.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <p class="strong">Are all consultations appointment-based?</p>
                <p>Yes!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <p class="strong">Will the fee be refunded if the doctor cancels my teleconsultation appointment?</p>
                <p>Yes, it will be refunded 100%.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <p class="strong">Will I be able to reschedule an appointment?</p>
                <p>Yes, but you can only reschedule before the start of the appointment.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <p class="strong">Will there be a cancellation fee if I cancel the appointment?</p>
                <p>We understand there are times where you had to cancel your appointment. But it also means you may be preventing another patient from getting that much-needed consultation. If you cancel an appointment, you may incur a cancellation fee.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <p class="strong">Can I have a record of my past appointment discussions with the doctor?</p>
                <p>Yes, discussions made through chats can be accessed, but the platform will provide no audio/video recordings.</p>
            </div>
            <h2>Homepage</h2>
            <div class="card">
                <p class="strong">Would I be able to add a family member, who does not own a phone?</p>

                <p>Under the &lsquo;Doctors List,&rsquo; you could see the doctor&rsquo;s names. Long press on the corresponding doctor's name. An alert will be displayed to &lsquo;confirm&rsquo; your action of changing/setting the preferred doctor. Upon
                    confirmation, you will be able to set your preferred doctor.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <p class="strong">How do I search for any of my family members&rsquo; health records?</p>

            <h2>Appointments</h2>
            <div class="card">
                <p class="strong">Can I make an appointment with Doctors?</p>
                <p>Yes, you can schedule an appointment with the doctor of your choice and receive their consultation.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <p class="strong">Can I make appointments using a web browser?</p>
                <p>As of now, you can make appointments using the myFHB app. If the hospital has integration with the FHB suite, you can book appointments even through the hospital website.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <p class="strong">Can I book appointments for my family members as well?</p>
                <p>Yes. But first, you have to add your respective family members to your myFHB app. Click the &lsquo;My Provider&rsquo; icon on the home page. Go to the &lsquo;My Family&rsquo; tab. Provide your family member name, among other necessary
                    details. Then proceed with making a doctor appointment for the family member.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <p class="strong">Do I get priority in appointments when using the myFHB app?</p>
                <p>QurHealth does not prioritize appointments. But, one of the major advantages of myFHB is it eliminates wait-time. When you schedule an appointment, you get a specific time-slot with the doctor, so you don&rsquo;t have to wait or let others
                    wait to receive care from the doctor.</p>
            </div>
