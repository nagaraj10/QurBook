        <p>When you visit our mobile applications, web applications, or use our services, you trust us with your Personal Information. We take your privacy very seriously. In this privacy policy ("Policy"), we seek to explain to you in the transparent way possible what information we collect, how we use it, and what rights you have in relation to it. We hope you take some time to read through it carefully, as it is important. By using our Apps and Services (as defined below), you agree to the terms of this policy. This policy may change from time to time. Your continued use of our Apps and Services after we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of those changes, so please check the policy periodically for updates. If there are any terms in this policy that you do not agree with, please discontinue the use of our Apps and our services. </p>

        <p>This policy applies to all information collected through our mobile application, web application ("App" or "Apps"), and/or any related services, sales, marketing, or events (we refer to them collectively in this policy as the "Services"). This policy does not apply to websites, applications, or other domains that are maintained or operated by third parties or our affiliates. Our App may link to third-party websites and services, such as Amazon, Microsoft, Adobe, Google, and Facebook, but these links are not endorsements of these sites, and this policy does not extend to them. Because this policy is not enforced on these third-party websites, we encourage you to read any posted policies of third party websites before using the service or site and providing any information. </p>

        <p>Also, we do not warrant or represent that this policy or the App's use of your Personal Information complies with the laws of any particular jurisdiction. To provide you with our services, we may store, process, and transmit information in India, the United States, and other locations around the world, including countries that may not have the same privacy and security laws as yours. Regardless of the country in which such information is stored, we will process your Personal Information in accordance with this policy.  </p>

        <p><strong>Please read this policy carefully as it will help you make informed decisions about sharing your Personal Information with us.</strong>&nbsp;</p>

		<p>All Personal Information that you provide to us must be correct, complete, and accurate, and you must notify us of any changes to such Personal Information.

Although your Personal Information will not be subject to the same protections and rights afforded under HIPAA, your Personal Information will be governed under the terms of this policy. </p>
		
		<p>You may have the opportunity to provide Personal Information related to other individuals. Before providing us with any Personal Information, be sure you have the appropriate authorizations and consent from the individual whose Personal Information you provide to us. By submitting Personal Information, you warrant and represent that you have acquired all proper authorizations and consent to share Personal Information. </p>
		
		<p>The information that you provide in each case will vary. In some cases, we may ask you to create a username and password that should only be known to you.</p>

		<p><strong>Use of Tracking Technologies</strong></p>
		<p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong>  We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information.</p>
		
		<p>We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store information.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Cookies: </strong>A "cookie" is a small data file transmitted from a website to your device's hard drive. Cookies come in two types, and we may use both of them: (1) session cookies, which do not stay on your device after you close your browser, and (2) persistent cookies, which remain on your device until you delete them or they expire. If you do not wish to have cookies on your devices, you may turn them off at any time by modifying your internet browser's settings. However, by disabling cookies on your device, you may be prohibited from full use of the Services or the App's features, or lose access to some functionality. Additional information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our Cookie Policy.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Google Analytics.  </strong>The App may send aggregated, non-Personal Information to Google Analytics for the purpose of providing us with the ability to conduct technical and statistical analysis on the App's performance. For more information on how Google Analytics supports the App and uses information sent from the App, please review Google's privacy policy available at <a href =  "https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites">  https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites. </a></p>
		
		<p><strong>Pixels.</strong>A pixel is a graphic with dimensions of 1x1 pixels that is loaded when a user visits a webpage or opens an email. The website operator or sender of an email adds the tracking pixel using a code in the website's HTML code or email. This code contains an external link to the pixel server. If a user visits the destination website, the HTML code is processed by the user's browser. The browser follows the link and opens the graphic, which is registered and noted in the server's log files.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Web Beacons. </strong>A Web Beacon is an electronic image. Web Beacons can track certain things from your device and can report activity back to a web server, allowing us to understand some of your behaviour. If you choose to receive emails from us, we may use the Web Beacons to track your reaction to our emails. We may also use them to track if you click on the links and at what time and date you do so. Some of our third-party marketing partners may use Web Beacons to track your interaction with online advertising banners on our App. This information is only collected in aggregate form and will not be linked to your Personal Information. Please note that any image file on a screen could act as a Web Beacon.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Embedded Web Links. </strong>Links provided in our emails and, in some cases, on third-party websites may include tracking technology embedded in the link. The tracking is accomplished through a redirection system. The redirection system allows us to understand how email recipients are using the link. Some of these links will enable us to identify that you have personally clicked on the link, and this may be attached to the Personal Information that we hold about you. This data is used to improve our service to you and to help us understand the performance of our marketing campaigns.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Third-party Websites and Services. </strong> We work with a number of service providers of marketing communications technology. These service providers may use various data collection methods to improve the performance of the marketing campaigns we are contracting them to provide. The information collected can be gathered on our App and also on the websites where our marketing communications are appearing. For example, we may collect data where our banner advertisements are displayed on third-party websites. </p>
		
		<p><strong>Right to Control Your Personal Information</strong></p>
		
		<p>When accessing our Apps and Services, you will have complete control of your personal information. In case of a request for the deletion of your personal information, you could send an email to <a href="mailto:info@qurhealth.com">info@qurhealth.com</a> Upon receiving your request mail, we will take appropriate action and duly keep you notified. </p>

Although we will do our best to protect your Personal Information, the transmission of Personal Information to and from our Apps is at your own risk. You should only access the services within a secure environment.</p>

		<p><strong>Data Legalities</strong></p>
		
		<p>Data is lawfully collected and processed at QurHealth, and the data rights subject to the user is always safeguarded at QurHealth.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Purpose of Processing</strong></p>
		
		<p>The personal data being processed is only to fulfil the purpose defined, and even if there are subsequent alterations to the said purpose, the changes of it would be limited and would entail further justification.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Transparency</strong></p>
		
		<p>In principle, data should be collected directly from the data subject. There must be prior communication with the subject with regards to the usage of this data. The subjects should be duly informed of the following:</p>
		
		<ol start="1">
			<li>The identity of the party using the data</li>
			<li>The purpose of data collection</li>
			<li>The time periods till which the data would be stored </li>
			<li>Transfer of the data to any third parties concerned. </li>
		</ol>
		
		<p><strong>Data Avoidance and Data Minimization</strong></p>
		
		<p>Before personal data collection takes precedence, the purpose of collection has to be thoroughly understood. If anonymized data or statistical data can solve the purpose, then it can always be preferred over the primary data collection efforts. Unless required for the purposes outlined in this policy or permitted by law, personal data cannot be retained for potential future use.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Retention & Deletion of User Data</strong></p>
		
		<p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this policy unless otherwise required by law.</p>
		
		<p>We will only keep your Personal Information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements.) When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your Personal Information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your Personal Information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your Personal Information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.In instances where there is a need to store the personal data owing to its historical significance or reasons worthy of storing the information, then the personal data can remain stored, provided the further retention time is legally specified or clarified.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Factual Correctness </strong></p>
		
		<p>Personal data stored must be factually correct, complete, and, if necessary up-to-date. Incorrect, outdated, or incomplete data will be accordingly corrected, updated, completed, supplemented, or deleted.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Data Confidentiality & Security</strong></p>

		<p>All staff members at QurHealth strives to pursue and observe the aforementioned goals and regulations pertaining to Data protection to the best of their abilities. In this regard, QurHealth depends on its organizational and technical measures, risk management strategies, training and privacy procedures, and methods that are constantly developed to pursue the same.</p>

		<p><strong><em>In Short: </em></strong>Yes, we will update this policy as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws.<br> We may update this policy from time to time.

		<p><strong>CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</strong></p>
		
		<p><strong><em>In Short: </em></strong> Since no uniform Technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalised, we currently do not respond to DNT requests</p>
		
		<p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online.
