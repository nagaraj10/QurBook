                <p><strong>Cookies</strong>: A "cookie" is a small data file transmitted from a website to your device's hard drive. Cookies come in two types, and we may use both of them: (1) session cookies, which do not stay on your device after you close
                    your browser, and (2) persistent cookies, which remain on your device until you delete them or they expire. If you do not wish to have cookies on your devices, you may turn them off at any time by modifying your internet browser's
                    settings.
                </p>
                <p>However, by disabling cookies on your device, you may be prohibited from full use of the Services or the App's features, or lose access to some functionality.</p>
                <p><strong>Google Analytics</strong>. The App may send aggregated, non-Personal Information to Google Analytics for the purpose of providing us with the ability to conduct technical and statistical analysis on the App's performance. For more
                    information on how Google Analytics supports the App and uses information sent from the App, please review Google's privacy policy available at <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites">https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites</a>.</p>
                <p><strong>Embedded Web Links</strong>. Links provided in our emails and, in some cases, on third-party websites may include tracking technology embedded in the link. The tracking is accomplished through a redirection system. The redirection
                    system allows us to understand how email recipients are using the link. Some of these links will enable us to identify that you have personally clicked on the link, and this may be attached to the Personal Information that we hold
                    about you. This data is used to improve our service to you and to help us understand the performance of our marketing campaigns.</p>
                <p><strong>Third-party Websites and Services</strong>. We work with a number of service providers of marketing communications technology. These service providers may use various data collection methods to improve the performance of the marketing
                    campaigns we are contracting them to provide. The information collected can be gathered on our App and also on the websites where our marketing communications are appearing.</p>
                <p>For example, we may collect data where our banner advertisements are displayed on third-party websites.</p>

                <p>The Personal Information being processed is only to fulfill the purpose defined, and even if there are subsequent alterations to the said purpose, the changes of it would be limited and would entail further justification.</p>
                <p><strong>Transparency</strong></p>

                <p><strong>Data Avoidance and Data Minimization</strong></p>
                <p>Before personal data collection takes precedence, the purpose of collection has to be thoroughly understood. If anonymized data or statistical data can solve the purpose, then it can always be preferred over the primary data collection
                    efforts.

                    other legal requirements.)</p>
                <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your Personal Information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your Personal Information has been stored in backup archives),
                    then we will securely store your Personal Information and isolate it from any further processing as may be required under applicable law until deletion is possible.</p>
                <p>In instances where there is a need to store the personal data owing to its historical significance or reasons worthy of storing the information, then the personal data can remain stored, provided the further retention time is legally specified
                    or clarified.</p>

                    and the Company will not be liable for such deletion.</p>
