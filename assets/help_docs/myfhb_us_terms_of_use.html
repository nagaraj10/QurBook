                            revoke any account, at any time without liability. QHI also sets terms on who can legally
                            represent the Dependent to use some of its Services on their behalf, which would be
                            Authorized Representatives, and these Authorized Representatives by doing so, certify that

                            information through their account related to QurBook Services. They also permit their
                            authorized Healthcare Provider to make communication to such Authorized Representatives
                            concerning such User's health status.</li>

                        <li>QHI grants User a non-exclusive right to access and use the QurBook Services and the data,

                            for commercial purposes. User agrees to use the QurBook Services only for lawful purposes,
                            comply with all rules governing any transactions on and through the Services, and comply

                            the Territory, then it is the User's responsibility to communicate to his/her Provider
                            or the relevant third-party of such changes since such modifications may not be directly
                            updated to such Provider or the relevant third party. In some instances, the User may modify
                            his/her Digital Health Record Data within the Territory directly through the QurBook

                            It is a complementary service offering the advantages of convenience and accessibility to a
                            broad range of healthcare services. QHI does not currently provide any emergency medical
                            services. Hence it does not qualify as an emergency medical services provider. USERS ARE
                            ADVISED TO CALL THE APPICABLE EMERGENCY HELPLINE NUMBER (i) AS NOTIFIED BY THE GOVERNMENT OR

                            as per Applicable Law. The processes that we use to manage our operations are governed by
                            extensive technologies that enable data security and help prevent any type of unauthorized
                            access and use. These security technologies include but are not limited to latest encryption
                            technologies accompanied by detailed security workforce training. Further the Company will
                            always use minimum, industry standard technical and organizational security measures to
                            transfer, store, and process Digital Health Record Data. These measures are designed to

                            and sharing it when You ask us to. The QurBook Application also provides You with features
                            like photo thumbnails, document previews, easy sorting, sharing and searching. These and
                            other features may require Our systems to access, store and scan Digital Health Record Data.
                            You give Us permission to do those things and this permission extends to our affiliates and
                            trusted third parties we work with.</li>
                        <li>QHI uses only User de-identified data to perform research and management operations, and

                            Aggregate Data and to such an extent You expressly agree and accept to provide us with Your
                            consent to use the Digital Health Record Data in the form of Aggregate Data. This Aggregate
                            Data can be used to bring out various insights related to User Demography, habits,
                            preferences, and usage to discover and generate positive health outcomes through innovative
                            programs, products, and services. QHI may also use User's Digital Health Record Data
                            within the Territory to comply with the law, manage its software and associated platforms,
                            and protect its systems. You expressly provide Your consent to allow us to share the
                            Aggregate Data within the Territory and outside the Territory for the performance of

                            The User may also authorize such Healthcare Providers to provide his/her Digital Health
                            Record Data to QHI for use in our Operations related to healthcare research and management.
                            In this regard, Users must understand that if and when the User authorizes the Healthcare
                            Provider then the Health Providers and their staff and other authorized Users can use the
                            QUR Suite Service to communicate with him/her and also access his/her Digital Health Record
                            data. In addition, any decision to use the QUR Suite Service in the above said ways is
                            voluntary. Also Healthcare providers and /or the Consultants can use this digital medium to
                            share data with Users to which the Users can either accept to receive data or deny them.
                        </li>
                        <li>QHI cannot be held responsible for acts of misuse or misidentification by the Healthcare
                            Providers whom the User has given authorization. In such cases, QHI's sole
                            responsibility would be, on further investigation, if proved, to discontinue access to such
                            entities or individuals. In all cases, QHI relies on authorized Healthcare Providers to
                            confirm that they meet the relevant criteria to use our QUR Suite Service.</li>
                        <li>QHI relies on the User to make appropriate decisions with respect to the authorization of

                            Provider or Authorized Representatives.</li>
                        <li>The User can revoke the permission given to Authorized Representatives, Consultants or

                            notified by the concerned Provider, or a court of law or agency with appropriate authority
                            that the Dependent has been emancipated or attained legal custody of his/her own health

                            entities. QHI may integrate User's Digital Health Record Data with third party digital
                            health records. Users should inform QHI if in cases of wanting the third-party provider to
                            use, provide, retrieve and/or modify their Digital Health Record Data. Once a User gives the
                            required authorization to a third-party provider to use/manage their account, until and
                            unless the User disables the said access, the third-party provider will continue to access
                            the User's account. In all regards, the User is solely responsible for the review and
                            approval of such third parties before the sharing, and the subsequent access of Digital
                            Health Record Data by third-party provider commences. Anytime QHI adds or enables service,
                            and a User decides to use it, then the User has given the authorization and consent to share
                            their Personal Information with all the authorized third-party providers.</li>
                        <li>Third-party content and services are not under the control of QHI, and QHI is not
