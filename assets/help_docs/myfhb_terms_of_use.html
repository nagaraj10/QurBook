                            investigation, if proved, to discontinue access to such entities or individuals. In all cases, QSIPL relies on authorized Healthcare Providers to confirm that they meet the relevant criteria to use our QUR Suite Service.</li>

                            Dependent. The Authorized Representative can communicate with the User/Dependent's Providers with regards to the health status of the User/ Dependent. Such transactions between the Authorized Representative and User/Dependent's

                        <li>Accounts created for Dependents are specific to each health care Provider. The account of the Dependent will be linked to the account of Authorized Representative till one of the following event comes first in time: (a) the Dependent
                            has reached the age of 18, (b) QSIPL is notified by the concerned Provider, or a court of law or agency with appropriate authority that the Dependent has been emancipated or attained legal custody of his/her own health information,
                            or (c) such authority over the Dependent has been transferred to another Authorized Representative.&nbsp;</li>
                        <li>Each of the Authorized Representatives understands the Dependent's QSIPL account may be possibly linked to other Authorized Representatives of the Dependent and that each of these Authorized Representatives enjoys the same rights
                            and access to QSIPL account of the Dependent. Each of the Authorized Representatives agrees to acknowledge that if in case of any changes in the relationship between the Authorized Representative and the Dependent, which possibly
                            led to a disqualification of the Authorized Representative to represent the Dependent, then it is in the disposal/duty of the concerned Authorized Representative to inform/advise the Dependent's Providers of the same.&nbsp;QSIPL
